# Crucial Conversation
by: by Kerry Patterson (Author), Joseph Grenny (Author), Ron McMillan (Author), Al Switzler (Author)

## Elements of a crucial conversation

- Strong emotions
- High stakes
- Opposing opinions

They can often come out of nowhere and catch us off-guard and we end up dealing with them in our worst state (emotional and un-prepared) 

---
## Two levers (Core)

### Learn to look
Be aware of when you are deviating from dialogue. 
Are people going into Violence or Silence mode?

### Make it Safe
People often engage in Violence or Silence mode when they feel unsafe.

*The 2 levers are often enough by themselves to diffuse a situation. Not optimal technique is better than doing nothing at all.*

---
#### Dialogue
A dialogue include one or more people participating freely to a conversation. When the free flow stops, the dialogue stops. 
#### Shared Pool of Meaning
The pool of meaning consist of all opinions, theory, feelings and experience about the topic of the conversation. Each participant has their own pool that they are using to fill the Shared Pool of Meaning. 

It is important that every participant are able to freely add to the pool. It can later on be curated, without leaving anyone feeling unheard.

*What goes in or out of the pool and what doesn't will directly affect the result of the conversation.* 
*People refraining from sharing in the pool will not feel any ownership toward the final decision.*

## Principles

1. Start with heart
2. Learn to look
3. Make it safe
4. Master my stories
5. STATE my path
6. Explore the others path
7. Move to action

---
### 1. Start with heart
- What *I am acting like* I really want?
- What *do* I really want?
	- For me?
	- For others?
	- For the relationship?
- How would I behave if I really want this? 
- Refuse the Fool's Choice

*Forget about trying to win or to keep the peace.*
*The only person you can control/influence is yourself* 

#### The Fool's Choice
When we believe there are only 2 options. They make us give up 1/2 of our goals.
1. Speak up our mind and make an enemy of the others.
2. Stay silent and keep the peace.
##### Antidote
"How can I speak up my honest opinion while remaining 100% respectful?"
"How can I have a candid conversation about our sex life and avoid creating bad feelings or waste our time?"

---
### 2. Learn to look

Look for when the conversation turns crucial. (physical, emotional and behavioral cues)
Look for safety problems. 
Look for you own Style Under Stress
Look for how people are responding to the conversation. 

#### What / Why
- Topic
- How people respond

*The longer it takes to notice that you are out of dialogue the harder it is to get back to it.*

Am I going to silence or violence?
Are the others going into silence or violence?

#### Violence / Silence Mode
- Using sarcasm
- Understating
- Avoiding
- Withdrawing
- Controlling
- Labeling
- Attacking

### 3. Make it safe

Condition for safety
- Mutual goal
- Mutual respect

Step out, make it safe, then step back in.
Apologize when appropriate 
Contrast misunderstanding (don't -> do)
"I don't want X, I want Y"
"I don't want to start an argument or to make you feel bad. But I do want to talk about the extra work I'm doing"
Create mutual purpose

When safety is absent people will either
- Force their opinions in the Shared Pool of Meaning (Trying to win)
- Withhold their opinions from the Shared Pool of Meaning
- Assume malicious intent behind neutral statement

Being forceful, aggressive and hurtful can therefore be a sign that the person is not feeling safe.

CRIB to get mutual purpose
**C**ommit to seek mutual purpose (3rd option that is not short-term compromise)
**R**ecognize the purpose behind the strategy (Strategy = way of getting what we want, not to be confused with what we actually want. Ask for it)
**I**nvent a mutual purpose "Lets make sure that we protect our good working relationship"
**B**rainstorm new strategy

Look for mutuality in 
- What do I want for me
- What do I want for others
- What do I want in the relationship

 Why is safety at risk?
 - Have I established mutual purpose?
 - Do the others believe that I care about their goals?
 - Are the others trusting my motive?
 - Are we locked in defending our personal interest / actions?
 - Am I maintaining mutual respect?

What will I do to rebuild safety?
keep an eye out for when you are the others start fighting to protect their ego/dignity at the expense of dialogue.

#### When to apologize
When you make a mistake / violated respect.
Not when you acted deliberately or when your intention are misjudged  (Use contrast instead)
The goal of contrast is to clear misunderstanding by providing context and proportion.
Contrast can also be used for prevention and first aide when introducing something to the pool that will make others defensive.

Don't aim for perfection, aim for progress

### 4. Master my stories

Retrace my Path to Action
Separate ***fact*** from ***story****
Watch out for the ***3 Clever Stories***
Tell the rest of the story

What is my Story?
What Am I pretending not to know about my role in the problem? (Playing the victim)
Why would a ***reasonable, rational and decent person*** do this? (Humanizing others)
What should I do right now to move toward what I really want? (Finding our power to act)

Realize that facts are not what triggers our emotion. It is our ***interpretation*** of those facts that triggers them. And our emotions tend to make us worst at dialogue.

Others don't make you mad, you make yourself mad.
#### Fact
What is observable in the world.
Example: Getting cutoff by someone when driving 
#### Story
What we use to give meaning to facts. Many different stories can be made from a single fact.
Example: The other driver is selfish and doesn't care about my safety / The other driver forgot to check their blind spot.
#### Path
1. See / hear
2. Tell a story
3. Feel
4. Act

#### Antidote
If you catch yourself acting poorly, retrace your path backward. Act -> Feel -> Story -> Fact 
- Am I in some form of Violence or Silence?
- What emotions are making me act this way?
- What story are creating these emotions?
- What evidence do I have to support this story?

#### The 3 Clever Stories
The common stories we tell ourselves to get us off the hook and justify bad behavior. They keep us from acknowledging our own shortcomings or sellouts.

1. Victim Story "It's not my fault!" (Exaggerate our innocence)(Not always in our head)
2. Villain Story "It's all your fault!" (Emphasize the others guilt or stupidity)
3. Helpless Story "There is nothing else I can do!" (Proclaim our powerlessness)

#### Example of Sellouts
- Believe X but not doing X
- I should show him how to export the database for local development. "He should have figured it out on his own"
- I should listen respectfully, but instead I become defensive

#### Antidote
- What Am I pretending not to know about my role in the problem? (Playing the victim)
- Why would a ***reasonable, rational and decent person*** do this? (Humanizing others)
- What should I do right now to move toward what I really want? (Finding our power to act)

### 5. STATE my path

**S**hare your facts.
**T**ell your story
**A**sk for the others' paths.
**T**alk tentatively (Be transparent, don't disguise your story as fact)
**E**ncourage testing (Invite opposing views, make it safe to share)

Am I open to others' view?
Am I talking about the real Issue?
Am I confidently expressing my own views?

Make sure you present yourself with:
- Confidence
- Humility
- Skill

Talking tentatively is not about whimping out "I know this is probably not true" vs "In my opinion / It seems to me that / I'm starting to feel like "

Encourage testing examples
- "Does anyone feel differently?"
- "I'd like to hear your side of the story"
- "Maybe I am wrong, what if the problem come from..."

The more we care about an issue the less likely we are to be on our best behavior.

---
### 6. Explore the others path

It is important to step out of the subject of the discussion and establish safety when we notice safety is at risk. People choose Violence or Silence to protect themselves from being vulnerable. 

We experience other people path in reverse: See+Hear / Story / Feel / Act(Fact?)
Try to unwind that path.

Apologize when you have offended through thoughtless act.
Use contrast when you are being misunderstood. (What you do and do not intend)
Find mutual purpose when at odds

**A**sk "Is there something I'm missing" (Be sincere / actually curious / interested!)
**M**irror "The way you are saying that make it sounds like maybe you ..."
**P**araphrase "Let's see if I got this right. paraphrase"
**P**rime(if needed) "Do you think I'm being unfair? That I'm not acknowledging you?"

**A**gree (if possible, find what do you actually agree on)
**B**uild "I agree that, then build upon it"
**C**ompare "I think I see things differently, let me tell you why" then share using STATE

Am I actively exploring others' view?
Am I avoiding unnecessary disagreement?
Make sure people are not agreeing as a silence technique.

While we are not responsible for other people's feeling and behavior, conversation cannot be fruitful unless everyone can feel safe to share into the pool of meaning. 
### Remember
- Why would a ***reasonable, rational and decent person*** do this? (Humanizing others)

---
### 7. Move to action

Once people are in agreement, it's important to 
- Decide how you'll decide (Type of decision making).
- Document decision ***and*** follow up.
### Type of decision making
- Command: When line of authority is clear
- Consult: Helps gaining support
- Vote
- Consensus
### Finish Clearly
Determine in detail and record / document
- Who:
- Does what (what you want / don' want)
- By when?
Then set a follow up time (hold people accountable)
### Avoid!
- Unclear expectation
- Lack of execution of what was decided upon

---
## Yeah but ...

---
## Afterword

"When things matter the most we often do our worst under the influence of our emotions"
"Emotions can feel very ***true*** in the heat of the moment, but are often very ***false***."
"Emotion can often blind us as to who we are dealing with (people vs monsters)"
"The simple knowledge that there are Crucial Conversation makes people better behaved."
"Even if you do and say everything right, dialogue will not take place if the other person doesn't want to. Being persistent and showing respect can help overcome"
